<p>A long time ago before the retreat of elves the Wood of Sharp Teeth was known as
Askavar a now ancient eleven community. Over time Askavar fell into ruin overgrown by the forest and overun by dire wolfs and 
other strange beasts. <span class="emph"><i>Now after 800 years</i></span> an ancient scroll has been discovered giving 
details of a stone buried deep beneath the ancient settlements. Believed to hold <span class="lge">awesome powers</span>  
in the wrong hands it could sway the balance of power in the region. 
You must find the stone before Chaos falls on the <b>Sword Coast</b>.

It is as we have feared. Teldorn has sent forth his group of mercenaries and is heading south towards the Sword Coast. They left Voonlar only five days ago and by the time you read this message they will be holed up in Dystra's old watch tower. No doubt others will meet them there until further orders are given. The finding of the Elven stone and the movement of these mercenaries is no coincidence. Teldorn seeks the stone himself, with it he could change the most good natured of peolple into evil minded murderers. We cannot allow this to happen. This small army must be stopped before they reach the Wood of Sharp Teeth. I leave this task to you my friend, gather whatever forces you can muster but hurry there is no time to lose.
